              "'This is a extremely well-made film. The acting, script and camera-work are all first-rate. The music is good, too, though it is mostly early in the film, when things are still relatively cheery. There are no really superstars in the cast, though several faces will be familiar. The entire cast does an excellent job with the script.<br /><br />But it is hard to watch, because there is no good end to a situation like the one presented. It is now fashionable to blame the British for setting Hindus and Muslims against each other, and then cruelly separating them into two countries. There is some merit in this view, but it\\'s also true that no one forced Hindus and Muslims in the region to mistreat each other as they did around the time of partition. It seems more likely that the British simply saw the tensions between the religions and were clever enough to exploit them to their own ends.<br /><br />The result is that there is much cruelty and inhumanity in the situation and this is very unpleasant to remember and to see on the screen. But it is never painted as a black-and-white case. There is baseness and nobility on both sides, and also the hope for change in the younger generation.<br /><br />There is redemption of a sort, in the end, when Puro has to make a hard choice between a man who has ruined her life, but also truly loved her, and her family which has disowned her, then later come looking for her. But by that point, she has no option that is without great pain for her.<br /><br />This film carries the message that both Muslims and Hindus have their grave faults, and also that both can be dignified and caring people. The reality of partition makes that realisation all the more wrenching, since there can never be real reconciliation across the India/Pakistan border. In that sense, it is similar to \"Mr & Mrs Iyer\".<br /><br />In the end, we were glad to have seen the film, even though the resolution was heartbreaking. If the UK and US could deal with their own histories of racism with this kind of frankness, they would certainly be better off.'"

              "  xxmaj it 's probably only considered a classic because \" a xxmaj christmas xxmaj carol \" is such a classic story . xxmaj just because the original story was a classic does n't mean that some cheap adaption is .,xxbos xxmaj wow and i thought that any xxmaj steven xxmaj segal movie was bad . xxmaj every time i thought that the movie could n't get worse it proved me wrong . xxmaj the story was good but the actors could n't carry it off . xxmaj also , they made a lot of mistakes on how proper xxunk digs are done . xxmaj for instance you do n't handle artifacts untill they are xxunk and accounted for . xxmaj the biggest crime in casting was the xxunk girl . xxmaj she is a weak actress and i felt that her acting really made the movie less realistic then it already was . xxmaj the whole concept of the knights templar being underground all these years seemed pretty stupid to me . i like the idea of how they disappeared and stuff , so that almost seemed depressing . i thought that the characters wern't explained well enough . xxmaj you did n't find out much background and that made it harder to relate to them .,xxbos xxmaj when i saw the preview , i thought : this is going to be a great movie . xxmaj and indeed it could have been . xxmaj the actress playing the main character was very credible , and the beauty of the filming is undeniable . xxmaj however the dialogues cast a dark shadow on the whole picture . xxmaj the level of language was too familiar and too contemporary for an action taking place in xxunk , and it took away most of the magic of the film . xxmaj however , i must congratulate the translator , because the xxmaj english sub - titles were more refined and appropriate that the original xxmaj french cues , and it probably explains the good rating the movie received on the imbd !,xxbos i saw the movie late one night on cable and could not believe how bad it was . i usually enjoy bad movies , but this one was so revolting that it was n't even entertaining . xxmaj some of the highlights of this film include the absurd music which is constantly playing throughout the movie , the hideous special effects ( when someone is shot with a laser gun they turn neon green and promptly disintegrate ) , and the disgusting acting . xxmaj the acting , in fact , is what i feel steals the show . i did n't recognize any of the actors in the movie , and i hope that i never have to see any of them again . xxmaj overall , i recommend renting this movie ( if you can find it ; i ca n't imagine a video store carrying this garbage ) just so that you can learn to appreciate quality films after seeing this trash .,xxbos xxmaj this could have been a good episode but i simply had to turn it off . xxmaj the xxmaj british representation was horrible to watch . xxmaj have the makers ever set foot in xxmaj britain prior to filming ? xxmaj at least set foot in xxmaj england ? ? i do n't think any xxmaj british person have had such an accent apart from a comedy skit of xxmaj the xxmaj royal xxmaj family ! xxmaj also with the 2 xxmaj english boys ... well i do n't think any xxmaj english boy has acted , spoke or dressed like any xxmaj english kid in the history of the xxmaj british nation since xxmaj prince xxmaj william and xxmaj harry 's preteen public appearances . xxmaj to xxmaj american film makers .. xxmaj there is more than 1 country in the xxup uk . xxmaj england , xxmaj wales , xxmaj scotland and xxmaj northern xxmaj ireland .. meaning more than 1 culture ! i can handle some stereotyping but this was so bad i could not watch it . xxmaj fire looked cool though !\n",
